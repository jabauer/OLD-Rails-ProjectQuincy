[REVISION 20071128]

[FIXED] Workaround to ensure plugin is only ever loaded once.

[REVISION 20071117]

[FIXED] Existing associations being overwritten.

[REVISION 20070528]

[NEW] Generation of has_and_belongs_to_many associations (see README for more details).

[REVISION 20070525]

[FIXED] Temporary work-around for HABTM associations: The code no longer barfs but you'll need to define the association manually. Still working on automatically generating the association but needed to get a fix out quickly.

[REVISION 20070412]

[FIXED] Eager loading tries to pull in a class before the association is defined, which throws an ActiveRecord::ConfigurationError.

[REVISION 20070321]

[FIXED] Sub-class meta-data missing if loaded before super-class.

[REVISION 20070224]

[FIXED] Removed useless assignment of class variable.

[REVISION 20070214]

[FIXED] Syntax error when generating associations from classes inside a module. Eg. CGI::Session::ActiveRecordStore::Session.

[REVISION 20061206]

[CHANGED] Lazily load meta-data during allocate/new rather than inherited.

[FIXED] Explicit table name ignored.

[FIXED] has_many/has_one relationships not loaded unless foreign key class has already been loaded.

[REVISION 20061013]

[NEW] install.rb informs user of missing dependencies.

[CHANGED] Separate modules into individual files.

[REVISION 20061012]

[CHANGED] Only read meta-data for base-classes.

[REVISION 20061011]

[CHANGED] Use include rather than extend in init.rb as this is more general. Plugin code can then determine if it needs to use extend or not.

[REVISION 20061020]

[FIXED] Breaks abstract class inheritance. If classes are named 'AbstractXxx' they will be treated as abstract. This is somewhat of a work-around for the current implementation however I believe it is a sensible choice for now.

[REVISION 20060919]

[FIXED] Only create has_one associations if the uniqueness constraint specifies no scope.

[REVISION 20060915]

[NEW] has_many associations generated with an order clause if the belongs_to table contains a position column. For example, given a foreign-key from a +order_id+ column in an order_lines table containing a position column, to an id column in a orders table, the plugin generates: OrderLines.belongs_to :orders and Order.has_many :order_lines, :order => :position.

[NEW] Remove prefix from has_many and has_one associations if the the name of parent class forms a proper prefix of the child class name. For example, Order.has_many :lines rather than Order.has_many :order_lines.

[REVISION 20060912]

[FIXED] 'Before updating scaffolding from new DB schema, try creating a table for your model (<model>)' when running ./script/generate scaffold <model>. Seems the scaffold sandbox dynamically creates classes which have no name.

[REVISION 20060909]

[CHANGED] Replaced dependence on defunct Foreign Key Support plugin with one on RedHill on Rails Core.

[REVISION 20060907]

[NEW] Generate has_one based on uniqueness constraints.

[REVISION 20060906]

[NEW] Generate belongs_to.

[NEW] Generate has_many.

[REVISION 20060905]

[NEW] Initial version.
