<!-- This partial view is called by a method in the application_helper.  It modifies the date columns in ActiveScaffold forms (edit, create, and update) in three ways.
	
	1. The year is converted from a select box to a text field, allowing the user to enter any (or no) year, within the parameters set by rails and the underlying database.
	2. Entering a value for the month is made optional.
	3. Entering a value for the day is made optional.
	
	This means that if no data is changed in the date fields, they will be recorded as blank NOT as today's date (the original ActiveScaffold Default.)-->

<!-- This first section of embedded ruby creates the necessary values to split the date field into its constituent parts of year, month, and day. 
	In the resulting array 
		year = [0]
		month = [1]
		day = [2]
	This overrides the ActiveScaffold javascript that knits them together in the form.  
	
	The parent_name is set to nil if the form is nested within another table.
	The variable col_name is defined and sub_col_name is used to handle columns from different tables.-->
