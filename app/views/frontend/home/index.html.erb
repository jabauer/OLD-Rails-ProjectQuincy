<h3>Welcome to the EAFSD</h3>
<p><span class="title">The Early American Foreign Service Database</span> (EAFSD to its friends) traces the U.S. Foreign Service from its early attempts at supplying the Continental Army during the American Revolution through the establishment of U.S. embassies in South America.</p>  
<h3>How to Use the Database</h3>
<p>The EAFSD is very much a work in progress.  I will be entering my research in fits (bulk loading) and starts (by hand) over the next several years.  As the data set expands, the ability to search and visualize that data will also be enhanced.</p>  
<p>Right now, you can <strong>Search</strong> or <strong>Browse</strong> the data, look at <strong>Maps &amp; Visualizations</strong>, or learn more <strong>About</strong> the larger project and its open source software.
